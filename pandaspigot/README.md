# List of Jars from PandaSpigot
Here are a list of PandaSpigot jars that I've collected after some time. I don't think PandaSpigot devs will support you installing older versions of their software, when there is a new one released.<br>
<br>
[pandaspigot-82.jar](https://github.com/MegaTKC/mc-server-jars/raw/main/pandaspigot/pandaspigot-82.jar): PandaSpigot (Build #82)<br>
[pandaspigot-103.jar](https://github.com/MegaTKC/mc-server-jars/raw/main/pandaspigot/pandaspigot-103.jar): PandaSpigot (Build #103)<br>
